===========================================

ExpressionEngine support package for Sublime Text 2 &amp; 3 that also supports the [jQuery bundle](https://github.com/mrmartineau/jQuery) syntax when inside of `<script>` tags. 

PLUS:

* Highlighting for built-in EE adddon tags (exp:channel:entries)

* Improved handling of EE comments:
* (does not highlight/color code blocks contained within EE comments)
* (recognizes EE comments within quoted strings)
* (recognizes EE comments and tags within Javascript blocks)
* (recognizes EE comments and tags within PHP blocks)

* Highlighting for EE module attributes (channel=, limit=, etc)

* Highlighting for EE global variables ({site_name}, {user_name}, etc)

* Highlighting for deprecated EE tags (marked as "invalid.illegal")



NOTE:

The HTML5 package for ST may override this package and prevent proper highlighting.
