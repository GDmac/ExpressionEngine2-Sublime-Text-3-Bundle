ExpressionEngine 2.0 Sublime Text 2 Bundle2
===========================================

ExpressionEngine Sublime Text 2 that also supports the [jQuery bundle](https://github.com/mrmartineau/jQuery) syntax when inside of `<script>` tags. 

PLUS:

* Improved handling of EE comments:
* (does not highlight/color code blocks contained within EE comments)
* (recognizes EE comments within quoted strings)

* Highlighting for EE module attributes (channel=, limit=, etc)

* Highlighting for EE global variables ({site_name}, {user_name}, etc)

NOTE:

The HTML5 package for ST may override this package and prevent proper highlighting.
